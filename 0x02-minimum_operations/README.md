## 0x02-minimum_operations

### Problem Description

In a text file, there is a single character `H`. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: `Copy All` and `Paste`. Given a number `n`, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` `H` characters in the file.

### Function Prototype

```python
def minOperations(n: int) -> int:
    pass
```

The function `minOperations` takes an integer 'n' as input and returns an integer representing the minimum number of operations needed to get 'n' 'H' characters. If 'n' is impossible to achieve, the function returns 0.

### Example

For example, if 'n' is 9, you would need to perform 6 operations: start with 'H', Copy All, Paste (to get 'HH'), Paste (to get 'HHH'), Copy All, and then Paste twice (to get 'HHHHHHHHH'). So, the minimum number of operations here is 6.


## Algorithm

The problem is essentially about finding the optimal way to multiply a number (initially 1) to reach `n` using only multiplication and doubling (which is equivalent to multiplication by 2). This is a variant of the unbounded `knapsack problem`, which is a classic problem in `dynamic programming`.

The function uses a `greedy algorithm` to solve this problem. The greedy choice is to always try to divide `n` by its largest divisor at each step, which is equivalent to multiplying the number of 'H' characters by the largest possible factor. This ensures that we reach `n` in the minimum number of steps.

The function tests for divisibility starting from 2 (the smallest prime number) up to `n`. For each `i`, if `n` is divisible by `i`, it performs the 'Copy All' and 'Paste' operations `i` times and updates `n` to `n / i`. This process continues until `n` becomes 1.

## Algorithm Complexity

The time complexity of the algorithm is $$O(\sqrt{n})$$ because in the worst case, we check divisibility for all numbers up to the square root of `n`. The space complexity is $$O(1)$$ as we only use a constant amount of space.

## Alternative Algorithms

The problem can also be viewed as a prime factorization problem where we want to express `n` as a product of prime numbers (which correspond to the 'Copy All' and 'Paste' operations). Here are three algorithms that can be used for prime factorization:

1. **Trial Division**: This is the simplest method for prime factorization. It involves dividing `n` by all numbers less than `n` and checking for a remainder. If a number divides evenly into `n`, it is a factor of `n`. This process is repeated for the quotient until we reach 1. The time complexity of this method is $$O(\sqrt{n})$$.

2. **Wheel Factorization**: This is an improvement over trial division that only divides `n` by primes and skips over multiples of primes. It uses a "wheel" (a cyclic data structure) to keep track of the primes and their multiples. This reduces the number of divisions and can be more efficient than trial division.

3. **Pollard's Rho Algorithm**: This is a probabilistic algorithm that can factorize `n` in $$O(n^{1/4})$$ time, which is faster than trial division. It uses a pseudo-random function (the "rho" function) and Floyd's cycle detection algorithm to find factors.

Remember, each algorithm has its own trade-offs in terms of time complexity, space complexity, and implementation complexity. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements of your application.

## Function Logic

The function works by finding the prime factors of `n`. The reason for this is that the optimal way to reach `n` is to copy-paste the largest possible divisor of `n` each time. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works:

1. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, or if `n` is 1, the function returns 0 because no operations are needed.

2. For `n` greater than 1, the function initializes two variables: `ops` (to keep track of the total number of operations) and `i` (to divide `n`).

3. The function then enters a while loop that continues until `i` is greater than `n`.

4. Inside the while loop, there's another while loop that continues as long as `n` is divisible by `i`. This inner loop represents the 'Copy All' and 'Paste' operations. Each time `n` is divisible by `i`, it means we can 'Copy All' and 'Paste' `i` times to get `n` 'H' characters. So, we add `i` to our total operations (`ops`) and update `n` to `n / i`.

5. Once `n` is no longer divisible by `i`, we increment `i` by 1 and continue to the next iteration of the outer while loop.

6. The function continues this process until `n` becomes 1, at which point it returns the total number of operations (`ops`). 

This approach ensures that we always use the largest possible divisor of `n`, which minimizes the number of operations needed to get `n` 'H' characters in the file.

## Usage

You can use this function in your Python script as follows:

```python
from min_operations import minOperations

# Calculate minimum operations for n=9
print(minOperations(9))

```
